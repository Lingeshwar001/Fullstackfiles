        <br><p>Abandoned and Chosen
           <p> The Adoption
             When Paul Jobs was mustered out of the Coast
            Guard after World War II, he made a wager with his
            crewmates. They had arrived in San Francisco, where
            their ship was decommissioned, and Paul bet that he
            would find himself a wife within two weeks. He was a
            taut, tattooed engine mechanic, six feet tall, with a
            passing resemblance to James Dean. But it wasn’t his
            looks that got him a date with Clara Hagopian, a sweethumored daughter of Armenian immigrants. It was the
            fact that he and his friends had a car, unlike the group
            she had originally planned to go out with that evening.
            Ten days later, in March 1946, Paul got engaged to
            Clara and won his wager. It would turn out to be a
            happy marriage, one that lasted until death parted them
            more than forty years later.
             Paul Reinhold Jobs had been raised on a dairy
            farm in Germantown, Wisconsin. Even though his father
            was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive, Paul ended
            up with a gentle and calm disposition under his leathery
            exterior. After dropping out of high school, he wandered
            through the Midwest picking up work as a mechanic
            until, at age nineteen, he joined the Coast Guard, even
            though he didn’t know how to swim. He was deployed
            on the USS General M. C. Meigs and spent much of the
            war ferrying troops to Italy for General Patton. His talent
            as a machinist and fireman earned him
            commendations, but he occasionally found himself in
            minor trouble and never rose above the rank of
            seaman.
             Clara was born in New Jersey, where her parents
            Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson 12
            had landed after fleeing the Turks in Armenia, and they
            moved to the Mission District of San Francisco when
            she was a child. She had a secret that she rarely
            mentioned to anyone: She had been married before,
            but her husband had been killed in the war. So when
            she met Paul Jobs on that first date, she was primed to
            start a new life.
             Like many who lived through the war, they had
            experienced enough excitement that, when it was over,
            they desired simply to settle down, raise a family, and
            lead a less eventful life. They had little money, so they
            moved to Wisconsin and lived with Paul’s parents for a
            few years, then headed for Indiana, where he got a job
            as a machinist for International Harvester. His passion
            was tinkering with old cars, and he made money in his
            spare time buying, restoring, and selling them.
            Eventually he quit his day job to become a full-time
            used car salesman.</p>

            <br>ODD COUPLE
           <p> The Two Steves</p>
          <p>Woz</p> 
            While a student in McCollum’s class, Jobs became
           friends with a graduate who was the teacher’s all-time
           favorite and a school legend for his wizardry in the
           class. Stephen Wozniak, whose younger brother had
           been on a swim team with Jobs, was almost five years
           older than Jobs and far more knowledgeable about
           electronics. But emotionally and socially he was still a
           high school geek.
            Like Jobs, Wozniak learned a lot at his father’s
           knee. But their lessons were different. Paul Jobs was a
           high school dropout who, when fixing up cars, knew
           how to turn a tidy profit by striking the right deal on
           parts. Francis Wozniak, known as Jerry, was a brilliant
           engineering graduate from Cal Tech, where he had
           quarterbacked the football team, who became a rocket
           scientist at Lockheed. He exalted engineering and
           looked down on those in business, marketing, and
           sales. “I remember him telling me that engineering was
           the highest level of importance you could reach in the
           world,” Steve Wozniak later recalled. “It takes society to
           a new level.”
            One of Steve Wozniak’s first memories was going
           to his father’s workplace on a weekend and being
           shown electronic parts, with his dad “putting them on a
           table with me so I got to play with them.” He watched
           with fascination as his father tried to get a waveform line
           on a video screen to stay flat so he could show that one
           of his circuit designs was working properly. “I could see
           that whatever my dad was doing, it was important and <p><a href="#Contents">Go to Contents</a></p>

           <p>THE DROPOUT</p>
            <p>Turn On, Tune In . . .
           Chrisann Brennan
            Toward the end of his senior year at Homestead,
           in the spring of 1972, Jobs started going out with a girl
           named Chrisann Brennan, who was about his age but
           still a junior. With her light brown hair, green eyes, high
           cheekbones, and fragile aura, she was very attractive.
           She was also enduring the breakup of her parents’
           marriage, which made her vulnerable. “We worked
           together on an animated movie, then started going out,
           and she became my first real girlfriend,” Jobs recalled.
           As Brennan later said, “Steve was kind of crazy. That’s
           why I was attracted to him.”
            Jobs’s craziness was of the cultivated sort. He had
           begun his lifelong experiments with compulsive diets,
           eating only fruits and vegetables, so he was as lean
           and tight as a whippet. He learned to stare at people
           without blinking, and he perfected long silences
           punctuated by staccato bursts of fast talking. This odd
           mix of intensity and aloofness, combined with his
           shoulder-length hair and scraggly beard, gave him the
           aura of a crazed shaman. He oscillated between
           charismatic and creepy. “He shuffled around and
           looked half-mad,” recalled Brennan. “He had a lot of
           angst. It was like a big darkness around him.”
            Jobs had begun to drop acid by then, and he
           turned Brennan on to it as well, in a wheat field just
           outside Sunnyvale. “It was great,” he recalled. “I had
           been listening to a lot of Bach. All of a sudden the
           wheat field was playing Bach. It was the most wonderful
           feeling of my life up to that point. I felt like the conductor
           of this symphony with Bach coming through the wheat.”
           Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson 51
            That summer of 1972, after his graduation, he and
           Brennan moved to a cabin in the hills above Los Altos.
           “I’m going to go live in a cabin with Chrisann,” he
           announced to his parents one day. His father was
           furious. “No you’re not,” he said. “Over my dead body.”
           They had recently fought about marijuana, and once
           again the younger Jobs was willful. He just said goodbye and walked out.</p><p><a href="#Contents">Go to Contents</a></p>

            <p>ATARI AND INDIA</p>
                <p>Zen and the Art of Game Design
               Atari
                In February 1974, after eighteen months of
               hanging around Reed, Jobs decided to move back to
               his parents’ home in Los Altos and look for a job. It was
               not a difficult search. At peak times during the 1970s,
               the classified section of the San Jose Mercury carried
               up to sixty pages of technology help-wanted ads. One
               of those caught Jobs’s eye. “Have fun, make money,” it
               said. That day Jobs walked into the lobby of the video
               game manufacturer Atari and told the personnel
               director, who was startled by his unkempt hair and
               attire, that he wouldn’t leave until they gave him a job.
                Atari’s founder was a burly entrepreneur named
               Nolan Bushnell, who was a charismatic visionary with a
               nice touch of showmanship in him—in other words,
               another role model waiting to be emulated. After he
               became famous, he liked driving around in a Rolls,
               smoking dope, and holding staff meetings in a hot tub.
               As Friedland had done and as Jobs would learn to do,
               he was able to turn charm into a cunning force, to cajole
               and intimidate and distort reality with the power of his
               personality. His chief engineer was Al Alcorn, beefy and
               jovial and a bit more grounded, the house grown-up
               trying to implement the vision and curb the enthusiasms
               of Bushnell. Their big hit thus far was a video game
               called Pong, in which two players tried to volley a blip
               on a screen with two movable lines that acted as
               paddles. (If you’re under thirty, ask your parents.)
                When Jobs arrived in the Atari lobby wearing
               sandals and demanding a job, Alcorn was the one who
               was summoned. “I was told, ‘We’ve got a hippie kid in
               Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson 66
               the lobby. He says he’s not going to leave until we hire
               him. Should we call the cops or let him in?’ I said bring
               him on in!”

               <p> Turn On, Boot Up, Jack In . . .
               Machines of Loving Grace
                In San Francisco and the Santa Clara Valley
               during the late 1960s, various cultural currents flowed
               together. There was the technology revolution that
               began with the growth of military contractors and soon
               included electronics firms, microchip makers, video
               game designers, and computer companies. There was
               a hacker subculture—filled with wireheads, phreakers,
               cyberpunks, hobbyists, and just plain geeks—that
               included engineers who didn’t conform to the HP mold
               and their kids who weren’t attuned to the wavelengths
               of the subdivisions. There were quasi-academic groups
               doing studies on the effects of LSD; participants
               included Doug Engelbart of the Augmentation
               Research Center in Palo Alto, who later helped develop
               the computer mouse and graphical user interfaces, and
               Ken Kesey, who celebrated the drug with music-andlight shows featuring a house band that became the
               Grateful Dead. There was the hippie movement, born
               out of the Bay Area’s beat generation, and the
               rebellious political activists, born out of the Free Speech
               Movement at Berkeley. Overlaid on it all were various
               self-fulfillment movements pursuing paths to personal
               enlightenment: Zen and Hinduism, meditation and
               yoga, primal scream and sensory deprivation, Esalen
               and est.
                This fusion of flower power and processor power,
               enlightenment and technology, was embodied by Steve
               Jobs as he meditated in the mornings, audited physics
               classes at Stanford, worked nights at Atari, and
               Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson 83
               dreamed of starting his own business. “There was just
               something going on here,” he said, looking back at the
               time and place. “The best music came from here—the
               Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Janis
               Joplin—and so did the integrated circuit, and things like
               the Whole Earth Catalog.”
                Initially the technologists and the hippies did not
               interface well. Many in the counterculture saw
               computers as ominous and Orwellian, the province of
               the Pentagon and the power structure. In The Myth of
               the Machine, the historian Lewis Mumford warned that
               computers were sucking away our freedom and
               destroying “life-enhancing values.” An injunction on
               punch cards of the period—“Do not fold, spindle or
               mutilate”—became an ironic phrase of the antiwar Left.</p><p><a href="#Contents">Go to Contents</a></p>
