       <br><h3>1.What is HTML?<h3>
       <h4><p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a tagged markup language primarily used for web documents. A tagged markup language means that the content is interspersed with instructions, tags, that mark up the semantic meaning of certain passages. HTML is an application of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), a more generic markup language.</p><h4>

      <br><h3>2.What does the DOCTYPE declaration do? </h3>
      <h4>The DOCTYPE declaration tells a validator (a program that checks the syntactic validity of a web page) against which DTD to test for compliance. Browsers didn’t used to care about the DOCTYPE declaration, but modern browsers use it for a completely different purpose</h4>

      <br><h3> 3.Which DOCTYPE should I use?<h3>
      <h4>If you are creating a new web page, the W3C recommend using HTML 4.01 Strict.

        If you are trying to convert an ancient HTML 2.0 or HTML 3.2 document to the modern world, you can use HTML 4.01 Transitional until you have managed to transfer all presentational issues to CSS and all behavioural issues to JavaScript.</h4>

      <br><h3>4. What does ‘semantic’ mean?<h3>  
         <h4>When we talk about ‘semantic markup’, we mean the proper use of element types – based on their meaning – to mark up content. The opposite is ‘presentational markup’ or ‘tag soup’, where authors choose element types because of their default rendering, rather than their semantic meaning.

            <br><h3> 5. Why should I validate my markup?<h3>   
            <h4>Why should you spell-check your text before publishing it on the Web? Because mistakes and errors can confuse your readers and detract from the important information. It is the same with markup. Invalid markup can confuse browsers, search engines and other user agents. The result can be improper rendering, dysfunctional pages, unindexed pages in the search engines, program crashes, or the end of the universe as we know it.</h4>

            <br><h3>6.How should heading elements be used?  <h3>
            <h4>HTML heading element types are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 and H6. The number denotes the structural level of the heading, which means we should look at headings as in those outlines we had to learn in school (and promptly forgot about right after graduation).

                The top-level heading on a page must be an H1. It should describe what the page is about. Most pages will only have one H1 heading, but very complex documents that deal with several disparate topics may need more.</h4>

                <br><h3> 7.Should I replace B/I with STRONG/EM?</h3>  
                <h4>Only if we really mean to emphasise something. They are not interchangeable.

                    In the Bad Old Days, authors would use B and I to emphasise words.
                    In the Equally Bad Modern Days, authors will use STRONG and EM to make text boldfaced or italic.
                    
                    EM signifies semantic emphasis. The content should have some sort of emphasis (louder, more slowly) when read out loud. STRONG indicates even stronger emphasis, but is now often considered to be redundant (you could nest EM elements to indicate increasing emphasis). Some experts recommend that STRONG be used only for certain page elements that should be clearly indicated (like a ‘current page’ indicator), and not to mark up words or phrases in the body copy.</h4>

                <br><h3>8.How can I include an HTML page in another HTML page?</h3>  
                <h4>With other server-side technologies you can do more advanced things. Your web server must support those technologies, of course. Shared servers with free hosting often don’t provide any such technologies – not even SSI.

                    Using JavaScript to ‘include’ things like navigation menus is not a very brilliant idea. That means visitors without JavaScript support won’t be able to navigate your site. In that case, using a FRAMESET might be the lesser evil.
